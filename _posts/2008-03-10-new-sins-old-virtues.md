title: New sins, old virtues
---

As if we didn't have enough rules to follow, Vatican has come up with 7 new sins. I forgot, deadly sins. How they managed to do it, I am not sure. From my catechism classes I was left with the impression that everything that you do is a sin.

Look at a girl, you have committed adultery; don't believe me? The thought is as bad as the deed, or so the Bible says. It also violates the commandment, "Thou shall not covet your neighbor's wife" and, "Thou shall not commit adultery". My teachers were so sure that God had chosen our soul mate and so anyone I look at is technically someone's wife.

The new list of sins include drugs, but my teachers had taught me that it violates the command "You shall have no other God before me" because if you become slave to drug, alcohol or any other 'vice' then you are placing someone else before God.

Apparently, Vatican thinks that with all the latest technologies we have at our disposal, we should be able to handle more than 10 commandments.

I guess I am not being entirely truthful. The 10 commandments and the 7 'old' deadly sins and the 7 'new' deadly sins are quite different.

The 10 commandments were given to Moses by God on Mt. Sinai. The 7 'old' commandments were listed by Pope Gregory the Great in the 6th Century AD. The 'new' sins were given out over the weekend and the new sins are... hold your breath...

1. "Bioethical" violations such as birth control
2. "Morally dubious'' experiments such as stem cell research
3. Drug abuse
4. Polluting the environment
5. Contributing to widening divide between rich and poor
6. Excessive wealth
7. Creating poverty

For those curious of the [old sins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_sins)

While the 'old' sins had corresponding virtues, new sins does not.

I am guessing that we have to
1. Breed like rabbits.
2. Eschew scientific study.
3. Stop drinking tea/coffee/Pepsi/Coke...
4.  Stop using everything and live like animals. They don't pollute.
5. Be Robin Hood. Steal from the rich and give to the poor.
6. Be a Communist
7. Never steal from the poor, only from the rich.

I think I am going to rot in hell.

Is the Vatican halfway between Heaven and Earth? To think that this is going to make a difference is pompous assumption. Vatican does a lot of good, but instead of trying to threaten they should try to teach.
