There is a very interesting Doctor Who story, from the 80's, ["Full Circle (Doctor Who)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Circle_%28Doctor_Who%29)" I had read it as a child and for some reason I thought about the story today. With the help of Google, I was able to identify the name of the episode and the book that I had read. The story revolves around the planet Alzarius where the Doctor and his companions found themselves stranded.

The planet (or rather the area) is inhabited by a humanoid civilization which crashed their spaceship 40,000 generations ago. They were trying to fix their spaceship, "Starliner" all this time. The complete story is not relevant to the point I am trying to make today. But the Doctor discovers that the spaceship was repaired centuries ago. The problem was, there was no one who knew how to pilot the ship. The leadership team, consisting of 3 self-elected "Deciders", had over the centuries kept up the charade of repairing the ship, rather than admit that couldn't fly even though the ship was fixed.

Imagine people replacing each part of the spaceship over and over, generations upon generations, with no clue about their fate. Think about what you do at your job. Are you fixing a problem only to repeat it 6 months into the future? Is it your fault or has the top-level management lost track of its objectives? Think about what is happening in your country and all around the world. Are we repeating the mistakes of our previous generations?

The human race has the ability to learn from its mistake, we should, considering we can put 1 and 2 together and call it 3 instead of 12. We have backtracked our history to 3500 BC and beyond to a certain degree. Watching the documentaries of [Michael Wood (historian)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wood_%28historian%29), I would say there are people who understand the mistakes of the past civilizations. Are our world leaders so short-sighted that they can see only 5 years into the future? Are the "wise old men", [The Elders](https://theelders.org), of the world sitting back on their chair sighing at the mistakes of the present generations?

>Strong leadership has never been more needed than it is today"

Out of context, but true.[Source](https://theelders.org/article/elders-appeal-directly-world-leaders-climate-change-strong-leadership-has-never-been-more-ne)

Do a favor to your grandchildren. Let us not force them to do the same thing that we are doing. Don't wait for someone to change the world, but ask for a change. It starts from one, becomes the need of many, until it becomes the need of the nation and the civilization.

> The Elders are an independent group of global leaders, brought together by Nelson Mandela, who offer their collective influence and experience to support peace building, help address major causes of human suffering, and promote the shared interests of humanity.

>The Elders are Martti Ahtisaari, Kofi Annan, Ela Bhatt, Lakhdar Brahimi, Gro Brundtland, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Jimmy Carter, GraÃ§a Machel, Mary Robinson and Desmond Tutu (Chair). Nelson Mandela and Aung San Suu Kyi are honorary Elders.
