I forgot that I had started working on this and to be honest, I could have sworn that there was an option to create posts with template through an admin interface. But that might have been on Netlify.

I have been tinkering with my VPS server which has the Wordpress site and I noticed that the server was running really low on RAM and considering that no one really reads my blog, and I have lost interest in the workings of Wordpress, I don't see any reason to keep the wordpress when I could use Github pages for free. It is not as easy to use and it doesn't have a mobile app, but since I haven't really written anything in years, I don't see why those things are imporant.

Let us hope this works!
