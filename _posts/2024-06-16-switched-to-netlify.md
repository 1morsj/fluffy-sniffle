Finally moved to netlify! This has been in my mind for last few years, but I guess I am just lazy.

I had this blog on on my last VPS for about 7 years and I really have to thank [Server Pilot](https://serverpilot.io/) for maintaining the server for such a long time. They kept the VPS up to date with patches and I didn't have to worry about it getting hacked, at least not through the OS. Wordpress was a different matter, but wordfence, cloudflare helped me keep it safe without a lot of oversight.

I don't know how often I will update this blog. Setting this up using github and netlify was a bit of a task, but now that it is done, I don't expect a lot of maintenance work. This should let me focus on the writing aspect of blogging rather than the fun part of pulling my hair out trying to figure out why things aren't working.

But here we are. From livejournal, to blogspot to wordpress.org to wordpress on shared hosting to wordpress on VPS and now on static site.
