<blockquote>
<p>The search for Knowledge has encouraged us to think of<em> the House </em>as if it were a sort of riddle to be unravelled, a text to be interpreted, and that if it ever we discover the Knowledge, then it will be as if the Value has been wrested from <em>House </em>and all that remains will be mere scenery.</p>
