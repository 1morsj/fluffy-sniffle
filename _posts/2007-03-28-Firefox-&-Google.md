I am a big fan of Firefox these days. It all started because IE started acting up with Gmail. Problem with the security settings. I tried changing the settings, but it seems there is some problem with the XP as a whole. I been having problem with it ever since I got my laptop back.

Well, I had installed Firefox a long time back, and I just started using it. I wasnâ€™t a big fan of tabbed browsing, but now I am. Multiple home pages, now thats a good feature, though IE 7 is supposed to have it.

But what I love the most, is the customization that is available with all the add-ons that are available.

I have been a fan of Google for a long time now. But recently I started using Google Calendar and Google Reader. Amazing products that you should use, if you are not using it already. Well of course you need some bandwidth. But then, these days bandwidth seems to be a trivial issue.
