I logged out of Facebook, not just closed the tab, but logged out. If I need to check Facebook, I have to log back in instead of just opening the page.

Facebook is a place where you meet fake friends and I'm tired of all the people who doesn't care about me. I know, I'm a lonely person.

Any idiot can have opinion on anything. I know, because I have. But on Facebook, even those idiots who are incapable of having a coherent thought can copy half-baked thoughts from someone else, a photoshopped picture would attract those mindless nitwits faster than honey attracts honeybees. I wouldn't mind it so much, if they had the ability to listen to reason and correct themselves.

Those handful of people who I consider friends don't need Facebook to contact me and I don't need facebook to remember their birthdays.

I would probably log in once a day, because there are many companies, developers who post updates on facebook, but you will not find me on facebook every time you log in and your friend stream will not be littered with things I find interesting.

Now that I won't be wasting my time on Facebook, I might have much more time to post on my blog, and maybe post all those "interesting" links here, where you won't be forced to look at it or even like it.
