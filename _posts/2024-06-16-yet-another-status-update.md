I started working on this and then forgot all about it. Well, this does take a lot of work and I didn't have a lot of time. 

Anyway, I have exported all the posts from wordpress and imported a few to github. I would have to review each edit out all the extra stuff added by wordpress and convert few html formatting to markdown foramt. This would give me an opportunity to weed out some unwanted posts, maybe edit a few or even post an update for those posts as a new post.

I am not going to import the comments and the process of importing is going to take some time. But  and I think I can switch over to github and take my time doing it. I will take a final backup of the wordpress installation before I nuke it.
