It is that time of the year. After ignoring my blog for months, I come back and is instantly dissatisfied with the theme, the content, pictures.. pretty much everything . So after spending about 7-8 hours, most of it spent searching for a new theme, I present before you the same old wine inÂ a new bottle.

This blog has always been and will always remain a work in progress. It looks prettier than its previous incarnations over last 9, 10 years. But the sloppy work I did then is showing up with each new theme I try. I would have to go through each post, all 190 published and 30+ unpublished checking for mistakes, setting a "Featured image" for each post and updating/removing links.
