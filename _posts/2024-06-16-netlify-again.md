I have the same git repository pushing out static page to both netlify and github pages. Netlify is able to do the build correctly and add necessary CSS, js and favicons. But it does not work in Github and I have no idea what is wrong.

I probably would go with netlify at the moment. I hope they stay in business, otherwise I will be forced to fight another battle with github pages.
